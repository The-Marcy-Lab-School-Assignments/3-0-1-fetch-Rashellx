# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer 
  The HTTP status code is sent by the server. The server sends these codes as a response to a request by a client (web browser). Shows how the request was processed.

` HTTP Status Code `  
```
Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

Important ones are 200, 201, 204, 404, and 500
