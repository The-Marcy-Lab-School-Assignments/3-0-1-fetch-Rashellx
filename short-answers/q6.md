# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - Tell us if request was successful or not.

2. `Response.status` - Tell us if request was successful or not. Shows a HTTP code on how the server responded.

3. `Response.url` - Final URL after redirects.

4. `Response.headers` - Shows information of the type of data we are getting.
